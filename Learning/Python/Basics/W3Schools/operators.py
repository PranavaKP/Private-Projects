#python logic opperators

    # and - returns if both statements are true

#python identity operators

    # is - returns true if both variables are the same object
    # is not - returns true if both variables are not the same object
    
#python membership operators

    # in - returns true if a sequence with the specificed val is present in the object
    # not in - returns true if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object
    
#python bitwise operators

# & - sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# | - sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# ^ - sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ - inverts all the bits
# << - shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
# >> - shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left and let the right most bits fall off
